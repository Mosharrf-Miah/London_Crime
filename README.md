# London-crime-SQL

## Description
This project centers around an extensive dataset encompassing various major and minor crimes that occurred in London from 2009 to 2016. I checked to see which year had the most major crimes, the number of each crime committed as well as analysing the increase/decrease of crimes from the beginning and end of the dataset. Digging deeper into the dataset, I wanted to see how crime varies between all the different boroughs and which borough experienced the most crime and to check to see if there are any changes in crimes levels depending on the time of year.
